Documentation for Warmup Assignment 1
=====================================

+------------------------+
| BUILD & RUN (Required) |
+------------------------+

Replace "(Comments?)" below with the command the grader should use to compile
your program (it should simply be "make" or "make warmup1"; minor variation is
also fine).

    To compile your code, the grader should type: make

If you have additional instruction for the grader, replace "(Comments?)" with your
instruction (or with the word "none" if you don't have additional instructions):

    Additional instructions for building/running this assignment: (none)

(B.1) Sort (file) : 30 out of 30 pts
(B.2) Sort (stdin) : 30 out of 30 pts

Missing required section(s) in README file : -0 pts
Submitted binary file : -0 pts

"make clean" : -0 pts
Segmentation faults : -0 pts
Program never terminates : -0 pts

+---------------------------------+
| BUGS / TESTS TO SKIP (Required) |
+---------------------------------+

Are there are any tests mentioned in the grading guidelines test suite that you
know that it's not working and you don't want the grader to run it at all so you
won't get extra deductions, please replace "(Comments?)" below with your list.
(Of course, if the grader won't run such tests in the plus points section, you
will not get plus points for them; if the garder won't run such tests in the
minus points section, you will lose all the points there.)  If there's nothing
the grader should skip, please replace "(Comments?)" with "none".

Please skip the following tests: (NONE)

| ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR GRADER (Optional, but the grader should read what you add here) |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Hi, grader! Please notice that if you want to test stdin, DO NOT use copy and paste in ubuntu.
I tested both cat and manually typing. They all worked. However, if you use copy and paste, it might
have some strange output. But I'm pretty sure my code will work if you give stdin in good way (cat or manually typing).
Thank you so much! : )
